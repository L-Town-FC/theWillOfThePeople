-The objective of the game is to pick a word that you think the person you're targeting will say within a given number of messages

-If the word is said by the target, you take the # of gbps that you bet from your target

-If the target doesn't say the word, they get your bet

-If a target says a banned word then they can now longer be targeted with that word in the future. If they go the game without saying the word that word can be reused in the future

-Messages in pugilism, blackjack, and dms are not counted because people farm in those chats
